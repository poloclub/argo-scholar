We introduce Apolo, a system that uses a mixed-initiative approach - combining visualization, rich user interaction and machine learning - to guide the user to incrementally and interactively explore large network data and make sense of it. Apolo engages the user in bottom-up sensemaking to gradually build up an understanding over time by starting small, rather than starting big and drilling down. Apolo also helps users find relevant information by specifying exemplars, and then using a machine learning method called Belief Propagation to infer which other nodes may be of interest. We evaluated Apolo with twelve participants in a between-subjects study, with the task being to find relevant new papers to update an existing survey paper. Using expert judges, participants using Apolo found significantly more relevant papers. Subjective feedback of Apolo was also very positive.","node_id":"42936c2f2f5c8f4152494b94609fb33ec6264b8b"},{"id":"ff80fa1e9b93ff966883881f11ce64ea7de8bdce","degree":1,"pagerank":0.09736438880286107,"paperName":"Balancing Exploration and Exploitation","paperAbstract":null,"node_id":"ff80fa1e9b93ff966883881f11ce64ea7de8bdce"},{"id":"70035dd78550d805988eaebfbf20912582ed24b8","degree":1,"pagerank":0.09736438880286107,"paperName":"Beyond Relevance: Adapting Exploration/Exploitation in Information Retrieval","paperAbstract":"We present a novel adaptation technique for search engines to better support information-seeking activities that include both lookup and exploratory tasks. Building on previous findings, we describe (1) a classifier that recognizes task type (lookup vs. exploratory) as a user is searching and (2) a reinforcement learning based search engine that adapts accordingly the balance of exploration/exploitation in ranking the documents. This allows supporting both task types surreptitiously without changing the familiar list-based interface. Search results include more diverse results when users are exploring and more precise results for lookup tasks. Users found more useful results in exploratory tasks when compared to a base-line system, which is specifically tuned for lookup tasks.","node_id":"70035dd78550d805988eaebfbf20912582ed24b8"},{"id":"b8acca2b94341a4873b1f2635450a8aecc311804","degree":1,"pagerank":0.09736438880286107,"paperName":"Flexible Learning with Semantic Visual Exploration and Sequence-Based Recommendation of MOOC Videos","paperAbstract":"Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platforms have scaled online education to unprecedented enrollments, but remain limited by their rigid, predetermined curricula. To overcome this limitation, this paper contributes a visual recommender system called MOOCex. The system recommends lecture videos across different courses by considering both video contents and sequential inter-topic relationships mined from course syllabi; and more importantly, it allows for interactive visual exploration of the semantic space of recommendations within a learner's current context. When compared to traditional methods (e.g., content-based recommendation and ranked list representations), MOOCex suggests videos from more diverse perspectives and helps learners make better video playback decisions. Further, feedback from MOOC learners and instructors indicates that the system enhances both learning and teaching effectiveness.","node_id":"b8acca2b94341a4873b1f2635450a8aecc311804"},{"id":"db111635390306f33de552b15297ddc9018a4a14","degree":1,"pagerank":0.09736438880286107,"paperName":"Individual and Collective Graph Mining: Principles, Algorithms, and Applications","paperAbstract":"Abstract Graphs naturally represent information ranging from links between web pages, to communication in email networks, to connections between neurons in our brains. These graphs often span billions of nodes and interactions between them. Within this deluge of interconnected data, how can we find the most important structures and summarize them? How can we efficiently visualize them? How can we detect anomalies that indicate critical events, such as an attack on a computer system, disease formation in the human brain, or the fall of a company? This book presents scalable, principled discovery algorithms that combine globality with locality to make sense of one or more graphs. In addition to fast algorithmic methodologies, we also contribute graph-theoretical ideas and models, and real-world applications in two main areas: •Individual Graph Mining: We show how to interpretably summarize a single graph by identifying its important graph structures.

As these systems augment our everyday lives, it becomes increasing-ly important for people to understand them and remain in control. We investigate how HCI researchers can help to develop accountable systems by performing a literature analysis of 289 core papers on explanations and explaina-ble systems, as well as 12,412 citing papers. Using topic modeling, co-occurrence and network analysis, we mapped the research space from diverse domains, such as algorith-mic accountability, interpretable machine learning, context-awareness, cognitive psychology, and software learnability. We reveal fading and burgeoning trends in explainable systems, and identify domains that are closely connected or mostly isolated. The time is ripe for the HCI community to ensure that the powerful new autonomous systems have intelligible interfaces built-in. From our results, we propose several implications and directions for future research to-wards this goal.","node_id":"2a0e4eeea84f6352a6ac012f10581e5a228b6a92"}],"edges":[{"source_id":"ff80fa1e9b93ff966883881f11ce64ea7de8bdce","target_id":"42936c2f2f5c8f4152494b94609fb33ec6264b8b"},{"source_id":"70035dd78550d805988eaebfbf20912582ed24b8","target_id":"42936c2f2f5c8f4152494b94609fb33ec6264b8b"},{"source_id":"b8acca2b94341a4873b1f2635450a8aecc311804","target_id":"42936c2f2f5c8f4152494b94609fb33ec6264b8b"},{"source_id":"db111635390306f33de552b15297ddc9018a4a14","target_id":"42936c2f2f5c8f4152494b94609fb33ec6264b8b"},{"source_id":"2a0e4eeea84f6352a6ac012f10581e5a228b6a92","target_id":"42936c2f2f5c8f4152494b94609fb33ec6264b8b"}]},"citationReferenceMap":{"42936c2f2f5c8f4152494b94609fb33ec6264b8b":{"top5Citations":[{"arxivId":null,"authors":[{"authorId":"2358497","name":"A.
