# Develop Argo Scholar

## Developing the frontend

Argo Scholar's frontend is written using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool chain, using [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) for state management.

Knowledge of React and MobX is necessary to understand the codebase.

Install node.js, head to `cd argo-scholar` and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. And run `npm start` to start the development version. The rest of the commands are also standard [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) commands, documented [here](argo-scholar/README.md).

## Developing the backend

Argo Scholar has a sharing server for sharing network snapshots. See [the Deployment Guide](deploy.md).

## Creating Live Demo on Surge to Test New Argo Scholar Features

After changes are made to the Argo Scholar code base, [Surge](https://surge.sh/) can be used to deploy these changes to a URL that can be shared with others for testing new features. 

To do this, you need to do the following steps:
1) Switch to the branch where your changes have been made and make a duplicate branch (e.g., named as "demo/branch-name" to help group all surge demo branches). Use the duplicate branch to complete the rest of the steps in order to preserve the files in the original branch.

2) Navigate to the Argo Scholar react-app in your terminal

3) Open the package.json file and find the `"homepage"` attribute. Completely remove the attribute: `"homepage": "https://poloclub.github.io/argo-scholar"`

4) Inside the package.json file, find the `"scripts"` attribute. Within this attribute, there is an attribute named `"deploy"`. Remove the value and replace it with `"npm run build && cp build/index.html build/200.html && surge build https://{YOUR DESIRED URL NAME}.surge.sh"`. An example is shown below:

  ```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node scripts/start.js",
    "build": "node scripts/build.js",
    "test": "node scripts/test.js",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "npm run build && cp build/index.html build/200.html && surge build https://your_desired_url_name.surge.sh"
  },
  ```
  
  5) The package.json file is finished. In the terminal, run `npm install -g surge`

  6) In the terminal, run `npm run build`

  7) Type `cd build` to switch to the build directory. Rename `index.html` to `200.html`. Then run `npx surge`.

  8) Running `npx surge` will prompt you to enter an email and a password of your choice, as well as the directory for your project. After doing this, you must specify the domain name of the link. Use the same name as what you used in the package.json file. After hitting enter, you will be given a shareable URL.
